## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

> blockquotes are fun

You can also [strike through]{.strike}, [cross-off]{.cross}, [highlight]{.highlight}, and [circle]{.circle} text

:::{.box}
